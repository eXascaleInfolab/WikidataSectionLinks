This method traverses the Wikidata graph and for those entities which are missing a Wikipedia sitelink it tries to find a match among neighbors' sitelinks.
Two preprocessing steps (`preprocess_wikidata.py` and `preprocess_wikipedia.py`) generate files required for running the main algorithm (`main.py`).
