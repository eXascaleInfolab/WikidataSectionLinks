# WikidataSectionLinks

Provides a source code for mapping Wikidata entities to Wikipedia sections. 

`all2all_matching` and `neighbors_matching` are two independent packages which provide implementations of two different methods of mapping. 

`convert.py` is a converter which converts the obtained results into a Wikidata dump format (either json or rdf).
